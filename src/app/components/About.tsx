        Hello! Iâ€™m <strong className="text-[#3b82f6]">Nisha Nazar</strong>, a passionate frontend web developer dedicated to creating visually appealing, functional, and user-friendly web applications. I specialize in building responsive and accessible websites that provide excellent user experiences.
        <br /><br />
        My journey into tech began with curiosity and experimentation. Over time, it turned into a profession where I now focus on using powerful frameworks like <strong className="text-[#3b82f6]">Next.js</strong>, <strong className="text-[#3b82f6]">Tailwind CSS</strong>, and <strong className="text-[#3b82f6]">TypeScript</strong> to bring ideas to life.

        I find immense joy in taking creative concepts and turning them into high-performing, elegant websites and applications. My goal is always to deliver the best possible experience for the users.
        <br /><br />
        Constantly learning and evolving as a developer, I take pride in writing clean, scalable code and ensuring that my work is accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities or devices.
